# DHT11-MQ2
DHT11 &amp; MQ2 Sensor Integration for IoT Projects
This repository provides code and documentation for integrating DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor) and MQ2 (Gas Sensor) into IoT projects using microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. The data collected from these sensors can be processed locally and transmitted to Edge, Fog, or Cloud systems using protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or CoAP.

Features

DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity with easy-to-use digital output.

MQ2 Sensor: Detects gases like LPG, smoke, methane, and propane.

Data Transmission: Supports MQTT, HTTP, and CoAP for sending data to Edge/Fog/Cloud architecture.

Preprocessing: Filter and transform sensor data before transmission.

Hardware Requirements

DHT11 Sensor Module

MQ2 Gas Sensor Module

ESP32

Jumper wires and breadboard

Setup & Usage

Connect the DHT11 and MQ2 sensors to the microcontroller.

Install necessary libraries for reading sensor data.

Configure protocols for data transmission (MQTT, HTTP, CoAP).

Run the script and monitor real-time sensor data.

Applications
